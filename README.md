# Advent 2017

I did [2016's Advent of Code puzzles][1] last year trying to do
[a different language every day][2]. It fun!

This year I want to try to do something a little differently: I'm going to do
as many of the puzzles as possible _each_ in one of the major paradigms, in a
language I'd like to improve in. Meaning, for each day, I'm aiming to produce

- An [OCaml][3] solution (functional programming).
- A [Factor][4] solution (concatenative programming).
- A [Prolog][5] solution (logic programming).
- A [Rust][6] solution (man, idk, I just want to learn Rust).
- A [Python][7] solution (Procedural? Object-Oriented? idk last 3 jobs had me
  using Python and I never really cared enough).

The goal here is to do a _bit_ more depth on the paradigms and languages I'm
less familiar with. While last year I got a ton of depth, I'd like to feel
less lonely jumping into a codebase in either of the languages above.
